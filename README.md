# miniirc

# Warning

This branch contains a miniirc v2.0.0 pre-release, the documentation is probably
out-of-date and breaking changes can and will happen without notice.

[![Python 3.4+]](#python-version-support) [![Available on PyPI.]](https://pypi.org/project/miniirc/) [![License: MIT]](https://github.com/luk3yx/miniirc/blob/master/LICENSE.md)

A relatively simple thread-safe(-ish) IRC client framework.

To install miniirc, simply run `pip3 install miniirc`.

If you have previously used miniirc, you may want to read the
[deprecations list] (last updated 2020-04-28).

*This repository is available on both [GitHub](https://github.com/luk3yx/miniirc) and [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/miniirc).*

## Parameters

```py
irc = miniirc.IRC(ip, port, nick, channels=None, *, ssl=None, ident=None, realname=None, persist=True, debug=False, ns_identity=None, auto_connect=True, ircv3_caps=set(), quit_message='I grew sick and died.', ping_interval=60, ping_timeout=None, verify_ssl=True, executor=None)
```

*Note that everything before the \* is a positional argument.*

### Typical usage

You don't need to add every argument, and the `ip`, `port`, `nick`, and
`channels` arguments should be specified as positional arguments.

```py
irc = miniirc.IRC('irc.example.com', 6697, 'my-bot', ['#my-channel'], ns_identity=('my-bot', 'hunter2'), executor=concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor())
```

If you are not doing anything with the main thread after connecting to IRC,
please call `irc.wait_until_disconnected()` to prevent Python from trying to
shut down while miniirc is still connected, breaking thread pools (in
Python 3.9 and later).

```py
irc.wait_until_disconnected()
```

### Parameter descriptions

| Parameter     | Description                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ip`          | The IP/hostname of the IRC server to connect to.          |
| `port`        | The port to connect to.                                   |
| `nick`        | The nickname of the bot.                                  |
| `channels`    | The channels to join on connect. This can be an iterable containing strings (list, set, etc), or (since v1.5.0) a comma-delimited string. |
| `ssl`         | Enable TLS/SSL. If `None`, TLS is disabled unless the port is `6697`. |
| `ident`       | The ident to use, defaults to `nick`.                     |
| `realname`    | The realname to use, defaults to `nick` as well.          |
| `persist`     | Whether to automatically reconnect.                       |
| `debug`       | Enables debug mode, prints all IRC messages. This can also be a file-like object (with write mode enabled) if you want debug messages to be written into a file instead of being printed to stdout, or a function (for example `logging.debug`). |
| `ns_identity` | The NickServ account to use as a tuple/list of length 2 (`('<user>', '<password>')`). For compatibility, this can be a string (`'<user> <password>'`). |
| `auto_connect`| Runs `irc.connect()` straight away.                          |
| `ircv3_caps`  | A set() of additional IRCv3 capabilities to request. SASL is auto-added if `ns_identity` is specified. |
| `connect_modes` | A mode string (for example `'+B'`) of UMODEs to set when connected. |
| `quit_message`| Sets the default quit message. This can be modified per-quit with `irc.disconnect()`. |
| `ping_interval` | If no packets are sent or received for this amount of seconds, miniirc will send a `PING`, and if no reply is sent, after the ping timeout, miniirc will attempt to reconnect. Set to `None` to disable. |
| `ping_timeout` | The ping timeout used alongside the above `ping_interval` option, if unspecified will default to `ping_interval`. |
| `verify_ssl`  | Verifies TLS/SSL certificates. Disabling this is not recommended as it opens the IRC connection up to MiTM attacks. If you have trouble with certificate verification, try running `pip3 install certifi` first. |
| `executor`    | An instance of `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor` to use when running handlers. |

*The only mandatory parameters are `ip`, `port`, and `nick`.*

## Functions

| Function      | Description                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------  |
| `change_parser(parser=...)` | *See the message parser section for documentation.* |
| `connect()`   | Connects to the IRC server if not already connected.      |
| `ctcp(target, *msg, reply=False, tags=None)` | Sends a `CTCP` request or reply to `target`. |
| `debug(...)`  | Debug, calls `print(...)` if debug mode is on.            |
| `disconnect(msg=..., *, auto_reconnect=False)`| Disconnects from the IRC server. `auto_reconnect` will be overridden by `self.persist` if set to `True`. |
| `Handler(...)` | An event handler, see [Handlers](#handlers) for more info. |
| `me(target, *msg, tags=None)`        | Sends a `/me` (`CTCP ACTION`) to `target`.  |
| `msg(target, *msg, tags=None)`       | Sends a `PRIVMSG` to `target`. `target` should not contain spaces or start with a colon. |
| `notice(target, *msg, tags=None)`    | Sends a `NOTICE` to `target`. `target` should not contain spaces or start with a colon. |
| `quote(*msg, force=False, tags=None)` | Sends a raw message to IRC, use `force=True` to send while disconnected. Do not send multiple commands in one `irc.quote()`, as the newlines will be stripped and it will be sent as one command. The `tags` parameter optionally allows you to add a `dict` with IRCv3 client tags (all starting in `+`), and will not be sent to IRC servers that do not support client tags. |
| `send(*msg, force=False, tags=None)` | Sends a command to the IRC server, treating every positional argument as a parameter. The usage of this is recommended over `irc.quote()` unless you know what you are doing. |
| `wait_until_disconnected()` | Waits until the IRC server is disconnected and automatic reconnecting is turned off. |

*Note that if `force=False` on `irc.quote` (or `irc.msg` etc is called) while
miniirc is not connected, messages will be temporarily stored and then sent
once miniirc is connected. Setting `force=True` will throw errors if miniirc is
completely disconnected (`irc.connected` is `None`).*

### irc.quote and irc.send

The two functions `irc.quote` and `irc.send` may sound similar, however are
fundamentally different: `irc.quote()` joins all provided arguments with spaces
and sends them as a raw message to IRC, while `irc.send()` treats each argument
as a parameter. If arguments passed to `irc.send()` contain spaces, they are
replaced with U+00A0 (a non-breaking space, visually similar to a regular
space however not interpreted as one).

#### Examples

 - `irc.quote('PRIVMSG', '#channel :Hello,', 'world!')` sends "Hello, world!"
    to #channel.
 - `irc.quote('PRIVMSG', '#channel', 'Hello, world!')` is invalid ("Hello," and
    "world!" are sent as separate parameters).
 - `irc.send('PRIVMSG', '#channel', 'Hello, world!')` will send "Hello, world!"
    to "#channel".
 - `irc.send('PRIVMSG', '#channel :Hello,', 'world!')` will send "world!" to
    `#channel\xa0:Hello,`, where `\xa0` is a non-breaking space.

*If you are unsure and do not need compatibility with miniirc <1.5.0, use
`irc.send()`. `PRIVMSG` is just used as an example, if you need to send
`PRIVMSG`s use `irc.msg()` instead.*

## Variables

*These variables should not be changed outside `miniirc.py`.*

| Variable      | Description                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------  |
| `active_caps` | A `set` of IRCv3 capabilities that have been successfully negotiated with the IRC server. This is empty while disconnected. |
| `connected`   | A boolean (or `None`), `True` when miniirc is connected, `False` when miniirc is connecting, and `None` when miniirc is not connected. |
| `current_nick` | *New in v1.4.3.* The bot/client's current nickname, currently an alias for `irc.nick`. Do not modify this, and use this instead of `irc.nick` when getting the bot's current nickname for compatibility with miniirc v2.0.0. |
| `isupport`    | A `dict` with values (not necessarily strings) from `ISUPPORT` messages sent to the client. |
| `msglen`      | The maximum length (in bytes) of messages (including `\r\n`). This is automatically changed if the server supports the `oragono.io/maxline-2` capability. |
| `nick`        | The nickname to use when connecting to IRC. Until miniirc v2.0.0, you should only modify this while disconnected, as it is currently automatically updated with nickname changes. |

The following arguments passed to `miniirc.IRC` are also available: `ip`,
`port`, `channels`, `ssl`, `ident`, `realname`, `persist`, `connect_modes`,
`quit_message`, `ping_interval`, `verify_ssl`.

## Handlers

`miniirc.Handler` and `miniirc.CmdHandler` are function decorators that add
functions to an event handler list. Functions in this list are called when
their respective IRC event(s) are received. Handlers may work on every IRC
object in existence (`miniirc.Handler`) or only on specific IRC objects
(`irc.Handler`).

The basic syntax for a handler is as followed, where `*events` is a list of events (`PRIVMSG`, `NOTICE`, etc) are called.

```py
import miniirc
@miniirc.Handler(*events)
def handler(irc, hostmask, args):
    # irc:      An 'IRC' object.
    # hostmask: A 'hostmask' object.
    # args:     A list containing the arguments sent to the command. Everything
    #             following the first `:` in the command is put into one item
    #             (args[-1]). If "colon" is "False", the leading ":" (if any)
    #             is automatically removed. To prevent your code from horribly
    #             breaking, always set it to False unless you know what you are
    #             doing.
    pass
```

By default, handlers are run in their own thread. To use the connection thread,
add the `thread=False` keyword argument to `Handler`.

#### Recommendations when using handlers:

 - Avoid setting the colon parameter to `True`.
 - Although `Handler` and `CmdHandler` currently accept any object that can be
    converted to a string, every event is converted to a string internally.
 - Not specifying the [`ircv3`](#ircv3-tags) parameter when it is not required.
 - To add handlers to a specific `IRC` object and not every one in existence,
    use `irc.Handler` and `irc.CmdHandler` instead. If you want to create a
    `Bot` or `Client` class and automatically add handlers to `IRC` objects
    created inside it, see
    [making existing functions handlers](#making-existing-functions-handlers).

### Hostmask object

Hostmasks are tuples with the format `('user', 'ident', 'hostname')`. If `ident`
and `hostname` aren't sent from the server, they will be filled in with the
previous value. If a command is received without a hostmask, all the `hostmask`
elements will be set to the name of the command. This is deprecated, however,
and when miniirc v2.0.0 is released the `hostmask` elements will be set to
empty strings.

### Making existing functions handlers

You can make existing functions handlers (for example class instance methods)
with `irc.Handler(*events)(handler_function)`. You probably don't want to use
`miniirc.Handler` for class instance methods, as this will create a handler
that gets triggered for every `IRC` object.

You can also add multiple handlers of the same type easily:

```py
add_handler = irc.Handler('PRIVMSG', colon=False)
add_handler(handler_1)
add_handler(self.instance_handler)
```

This is useful if you want to create a `Bot` (or `Client`) class and add
class-specific handlers without creating global process-wide handlers or
creating a wrapper function for every class instance.

### IRCv3 support

#### IRCv3 tags

If you want your handler to support IRCv3 message tags, you need to add
`ircv3=True` to the `Handler` or `CmdHandler` decorator. You will need to add a
`tags` parameter to your function after `hostmask`. IRCv3 tags are sent to the
handlers as `dict`s, with values of either strings or `True`.

*miniirc will automatically un-escape IRCv3 tag values.*

```py
import miniirc
@miniirc.Handler(*events, ircv3=True)
def handler(irc, hostmask, tags, args):
    pass
```

#### IRCv3 capabilities

You can handle IRCv3 capabilities before connecting using a handler.
You must use `force=True` on any `irc.quote()` called here, as when this is
called, miniirc may not be fully connected yet.

```py
import miniirc
@miniirc.Handler('IRCv3 my-cap-name')
def handler(irc, hostmask, args):
    # Process the capability here

    # IRCv3.2 capabilities:
    #   args = ['my-cap-name', 'IRCv3.2-parameters']

    # IRCv3.1 capabilities:
    #   args = ['my-cap-name']

    # Remove the capability from the processing list.
    irc.finish_negotiation(args[0]) # This can also be 'my-cap-name'.
```

### Custom message parsers (not recommended)

<details><summary>Documentation on custom message parsers</summary>

If the IRC server you are connecting to supports a non-standard message syntax,
you can create custom message parsers. These are called with the raw message
(as a string) and can either return `None` to ignore the message or an instance
of `IRCMessage`.

#### Message parser example

This message parser makes the normal parser allow `~` as an IRCv3 tag prefix character.

```py
import miniirc

def my_message_parser(raw_msg):
    if msg.startswith('~'):
        msg = '@' + msg[1:]
    elif msg == 'test':
        return miniirc.IRCMessage('PRIVMSG', ('nick', 'user', 'host'), {},
                                  ['#channel', 'This is a testing message!'])
    return miniirc.ircv3_message_parser(msg)
```

#### Changing message parsers

To change message parsers, you can use `irc.change_parser(func=...)`. If `func` is not
specified, it will default to the built-in parser. You can only change message parsers
on-the-fly (for example in an IRCv3 CAP handler). If you need to change message parsers
before connecting, you can disable `auto_connect` and change it then.

```py
irc = miniirc.IRC(..., auto_connect=False)
irc.change_parser(my_message_parser)
irc.connect()
```

</details>

### Handling multiple events

If you want to handle multiple events and/or be able to get the name of the
event being triggered, you can use `irc.CmdHandler`. This will pass an extra
`command` argument to the handler function (between `irc` and `hostmask`),
containing a string with the command name (such as `PRIVMSG`).

#### Catch-all handlers

**Please do not use these unless there is no other alternative.**

If you want to handle *every* event, you can use catch-all handlers. To create
these, you can call `irc.CmdHandler()` *without* any parameters. Note that this
handler will be called many times while connecting (and once connected).

*You cannot call `irc.Handler()` without parameters.*

### Example

```py
import miniirc
assert miniirc.ver >= (2,0,0)

@miniirc.Handler('PRIVMSG', 'NOTICE')
def handler(irc, hostmask, args):
    print(hostmask[0], 'sent a message to', args[0], 'with content', args[1])
    # nickname sent a message to #channel with content Hello, world!

@miniirc.CmdHandler('PRIVMSG', 'NOTICE')
def cmdhandler(irc, command, hostmask, args):
    print(hostmask[0], 'sent a', command, 'to', args[0], 'with content',
        args[1])
    # nickname sent a PRIVMSG to #channel with content Hello, world!
```

This will print a line whenever the bot gets a `PRIVMSG` or `NOTICE`.

## Misc functions

miniirc provides the following helper functions:

| Name                          | Description                               |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `miniirc.get_ca_certs()`      | Runs `certifi.where()` if `certifi` is installed, otherwise returns `None`. |
| `miniirc.ircv3_message_parser(msg)` | The default IRCv2/IRCv3 message parser, returns `cmd, hostmask, tags, args`. |
| `miniirc.ver`                 | A tuple containing version information.   |
| `miniirc.version`             | The `CTCP VERSION` reply, can be changed. |

The version numbering system should be similar to [SemVer](https://semver.org/),
however backwards compatibility is preserved where possible when major releases
change.

## Python version support

 - Python 3.3 and below are unsupported and do not work with miniirc.
 - Python 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6 are currently supported, but support will likely be
   dropped in miniirc v2.1.0. Major bugfixes may be backported to v2.0 for a
   few months after v2.1's release.
 - Python 3.7 and above should work with the latest stable version of miniirc.

If there is a bug/error in Python 3.4 or newer, please open an issue or pull
request on [GitHub](https://github.com/luk3yx/miniirc/issues) or
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/miniirc/issues).

*If you are using Python 3.7 or an older version of Python, I strongly
recommend updating. Later versions of Python include features such as f-strings
that make software development easier.*

## miniirc_matrix and miniirc_discord

The [miniirc_matrix](https://pypi.org/project/miniirc-matrix) and
[miniirc_discord](https://pypi.org/project/miniirc-discord) libraries allow
your existing bot to connect to Matrix and Discord with minimal code changes.
Note that these libraries only support a subset of what IRC does and are
limited. See the "supported commands" section of their documentation for more
information.

## miniirc_extras

If you want more advanced(-ish) features such as user tracking, you can use
[miniirc_extras](https://pypi.org/project/miniirc-extras/)
([GitHub](https://github.com/luk3yx/miniirc_extras),
[GitLab](https://gitlab.com/luk3yx/miniirc_extras)). Note that miniirc_extras
is still in beta and there will be breaking API changes in the future.

## Deprecations

 - The `colon` keyword argument to `Handler` is deprecated and should be
   avoided unless you need compatibility with miniirc 1.
 - As stated in the Python version support section, Python 3.4 support will be
   dropped in miniirc v2.1.0, however bugfixes will be backported for a few
   months.

## Migrating to miniirc 2

miniirc 2 was released on (TODO). Major breaking changes are listed below, with
ones more likely to break code listed first.

### The colon keyword argument

The `colon` keyword argument to `Handler` and `CmdHandler` now defaults to
`False` instead of `True`.

This means that the last argument passed to handlers (`args[-1]`) will no
longer start with a colon if it previously did.

#### Example

While the following code would work as expected in miniirc v1, in miniirc v2 it
would ignore the first character of chat messages.

```py
# Warning: This code does not work properly in miniirc v2!
@irc.Handler('PRIVMSG')
def handle_privmsg(irc, hostmask, args):
    # args in miniirc v1: ['#channel', ':Message']
    # args in miniirc v2: ['#channel', 'Message']
    message = args[-1][1:]

    # In miniirc v1: message == 'Message'
    # In miniirc v2: message == 'essage'

    if message.lower().startswith('.help'):
        irc.notice(args[0], 'I am a testing bot.')
```

To fix this, remove the code that ignores (`[1:]`) as shown below. If you want
your code to continue to work on miniirc v1, you can add `colon=False` to the
handler definition.

```py
@irc.Handler('PRIVMSG', colon=False)
def handle_privmsg(irc, hostmask, args):
    # args in miniirc v1: ['#channel', 'Message']
    # args in miniirc v2: ['#channel', 'Message']
    message = args[-1]

    # In miniirc v1: message == 'Message'
    # In miniirc v2: message == 'Message'

    if message.lower().startswith('.help'):
        irc.notice(args[0], 'I am a testing bot.')
```

### irc.current_nick

The `irc.nick` value is now the nickname used when connecting to IRC rather
than the current nickname the bot/client has. Use `irc.current_nick` for the
current nickname. This was done to fix a bug where miniirc would continue to
append `_` to nicknames if they were unavailable.

### `extended-join` capability

The `extended-join` capability is now requested by default. In `JOIN` handlers,
`args[0]` should be used instead of `args[-1]` to get the channel as
`extended-join` adds extra arguments to `JOIN` messages.

### Minor breaking changes that likely won't impact most people

- Unspecified hostmasks will be an empty string instead of the command. Don't
  rely on this "feature" if possible, simply ignore the hostmask if you do
  not need it.
- `irc.ns_identity` will be stored as a tuple instead of a string, for example
   `('username', 'password with spaces')` instead of
   `'username password with spaces'`. Both formats are still accepted in the
   `ns_identity` keyword argument.
- No exceptions will be raised in `irc.quote`/`irc.send` with `force=True`
  when the socket is closed. Instead of relying on these exceptions, use
  `irc.connected` which is set to `None` when completely disconnected.
- The `tags` argument passed to handlers is now read-only.
- Internal-only attributes `irc.handlers`, `irc.sock`, and `irc.sendq`
  (please do not use these) have been renamed.

## Working examples/implementations
